## Basics
Hi there! I'm Adi. I'm a mathematician and software developer. My research area is discrete mathematics/combinatorics with a focus on graph theory, and I've developed a strong interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning. I am also highly interested in applied probability and number theory/cryptography.

## Personal Interests
When I'm not doing math, I have a bunch of hobbies that keep me busy. I like the arts, drawing, playing music with friends, and shooting arrows at the range, among other things. Electronics (as in transistors, not iPads) have been a passion of mine since childhood.

I make a really mean pizza from scratch.

I'm a huge fan of the outdoors, hiking, and generally being in nature. I'm also a fitness/nutrition nut. 
So if you want to learn about effective workout and dieting strategies, I'm your guy.
